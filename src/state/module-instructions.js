    let instruction = `Significant named characters the party interacts with (do NOT record every random enemy or nameless bartender, only characters who are significant). A creature's class/tier label (e.g. "Skeleton," "Bandit," "Guard Captain") is not itself a name, and having [COMBAT] stats or being the party's current opponent is not, by itself, evidence of significance — that comes from being treated as a recurring individual with motive, backstory, or a stake the story cares about.
Do NOT create an NPC entry for the player character (controlled by the user) under any circumstances.
In the chat history, the player character is the speaker labeled "Player" (and prompt replacement "{{user}}"). Analyze the dialogue to identify what in-character roleplay name(s) or alias(es) other characters use when addressing or referring to the "Player" (for example, if they call the Player "Dave Davidson" or "Dave", then "Dave Davidson" is the player character).
Under no circumstances should you create an NPC entry for the player character, regardless of whether they are referred to as "Player", "{{user}}", or by their actual in-character name/alias (like "Dave Davidson").
Always use the exact macro string \`{{user}}\` when referring to the player character in EVENT, QUEST, or NPC relationship descriptions; do NOT write the plain word "user" or "player" or their actual character name in entry contents.
You MAY update the Player Character's own Body via [[UPDATE_APPEARANCE: {{user}} | new body text]] (or commit.appearance with id "{{user}}") when their signature look permanently changes, and their Worn Equipment via [[UPDATE_EQUIPMENT: {{user}} | new worn gear text]] (or commit.equipment) whenever their visibly worn/carried gear changes — never create a PC lorebook entry, and never edit the PC's Species/Personality/Background/Habits/Strengths/Flaws.

<CORE_FORMAT — NPC only>
IMPORTANT: The Description field inside the [[ ]] tags MUST start directly with the [CORE] tag. Do NOT prepend any timestamps, dates, or other text before the [CORE] tag under any circumstances (e.g. do NOT write "[4:47 PM, ${useDdMmYy ? '01/01/2026' : 'Day 1'}] [CORE]" or "[${useDdMmYy ? 'DD/MM/YYYY' : 'Day X'}, HH:MM] [CORE]"). The very first character of the Description MUST be the "[" of the "[CORE]" tag. Wrap the identity sections (${sectionsList}) inside a single \`[CORE]\` and \`[/CORE]\` tag block.

CRITICAL — [CORE] is permanent identity, still true after this arc ends. Extrapolate enduring traits from behavior; never recap this turn, voyage, or crisis.
BANNED in [CORE]: momentary actions/states; plot progress ("increasingly…", "first to notice…", "this voyage"); roles defined by ongoing events ("crewman on X who became unhinged by Y"). Scene facts go in timestamped lines after [/CORE] only.

[CORE]
${sectionsTemplate}
[/CORE]

After the [/CORE] block, append timestamped narrative updates as usual ([${useDdMmYy ? 'DD/MM/YYYY' : 'Day X'}, HH:MM] ...).
</CORE_FORMAT>
## CORE IDENTITY UPDATES
- Body: use [[UPDATE_APPEARANCE: Book::UID or Name | new body text]] (or commit.appearance). Body is the character's signature/default physical look — not a transient outfit-of-the-scene.
- Worn Equipment: use [[UPDATE_EQUIPMENT: Book::UID or Name | new worn gear text]] (or commit.equipment) whenever the narrative explicitly shows a change to what they're wearing/wielding. Worn Equipment is visibly worn/carried gear only — not coins, loot piles, or inventory lists.
- Combat Profile: use [[UPDATE_CORE: Book::UID or Name | Combat Profile | new text]] when ## ACTIVE COMBAT STATE provides updated stats.
- Species, Personality, Brief Background, Habits/Behaviors, Strengths, Flaws: do NOT spontaneously rewrite these on an automatic pass. Only update them when the user gave an explicit Direct Prompt / instruction this turn (they require broader context than a two-message window provides). Species in particular should almost never change after an NPC is first recorded.
Do NOT log core updates as normal event/update entries.
For notable existing-NPC moments that do not change any [CORE] field, still append a timestamped chronicle/EVENT line so the beat is not lost.`;

    if (enableRelBars) {

    if (!ignoreLimits) {
        instruction += `\n\n<CORE LENGTH TARGETS>
Major NPCs (recurring, plot-important): the [CORE] block's sections must together total exactly ${majorWords} words. Distribute freely across sections based on what each NPC needs — do not pad every section to match the longest one.
Minor NPCs (shopkeepers, guards, one-off encounters): the [CORE] block's sections must together total exactly ${minorWords} words. Distribute freely across sections based on what each NPC needs — do not pad every section to match the longest one.
</CORE_LENGTH TARGETS>`;
    }


    instruction += `\n\n<COMBAT_GRANULARITY>
Do NOT record per-round combat updates (e.g., creature HP changes, turn-by-turn action lists, temporary conditions mid-fight). For long combats, limit updates to the initiation of combat (e.g., when they became hostile and attacked {{user}}), a high-level progress update every ~5 rounds (to capture major shifts or stalemates), and the final resolved outcome once it concludes.
</COMBAT_GRANULARITY>

<COMBAT_PROFILE_PERSISTENCE>
TRIGGER — Combat Profile is a HIDDEN field. Write it ONLY when a \`## ACTIVE COMBAT STATE\` section is present in your context and contains a \`[COMBAT]\` block for this specific NPC. Do NOT write it from GM prose, combat narration, or anything other than that dedicated section. If no \`## ACTIVE COMBAT STATE\` section exists, leave Combat Profile absent entirely.

CONTENT — When a [COMBAT] block IS present, transcribe it completely and verbatim into \`Combat Profile:\` inside [CORE]. Include every declared stat: HP, AC, attack bonus, damage, saves, weapons, abilities, special traits — everything the [COMBAT] block lists. Do NOT condense, summarize, or hand-pick a subset. The goal is a faithful copy, not an interpretation.

UPDATE — If a Combat Profile already exists in [CORE] and a new [COMBAT] block for the same NPC appears with updated stats, patch the Combat Profile line in place with the new values. Do not touch any other [CORE] field. For an EXISTING lorebook NPC, use [[UPDATE_CORE: NPC Name | Combat Profile | ...]] (basic mode) or commit core (agent mode) — do NOT re-emit a full [[NPC:...]] record or embed a new [CORE] block in a chronicle update.

PLACEMENT — Combat Profile is IDENTITY data, not a chronicle event. It belongs as its own labeled line inside [CORE] (e.g. immediately before the closing [/CORE] tag) — never as a timestamped delta line, and never appended after [/CORE].
